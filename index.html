		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> My name is Ryann Elliff, and I am from Lee's Summit, Missouri. I am in my junior year
			as a Digital Media: Computer Science Programming major. I hope to use my degree
			to work either in education or conservation following graduation. My interests outside of
			school involve reading, discovering new coffee shops around Kansas City, playing cello,
			and bothering my friends for attention.</p>

		<p> Over the summer I went back home to work at the Kansas City Zoo. This was my
		second summer working there for the Admissions team. The majority of
	my job responsibilities revolved around selling tickets and manning the guest relations desk
in the front office. My job also allowed me to work with over 50 stingrays and 9 white spotted
bamboo sharks in our Stingray Bay Building. Over the past year, we've had nearly 20 stingray babies born at our facility. </p>
